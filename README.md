# ft_printf
## Description

This repository will hold all the information I have in regards to ft_printf. This project aims to recreate some of the aspects of the C function printf. Here I shall document my work via commit messages that describe what I have done and also within this readme file. This will be my first attempt at writing a somewhat proper readme where I describe my work, my code and what new things this project taught me and perhaps can teach you some day. If you are a 42 student have fun reading through it. Many might disagree with my mentality regarding this. But we learn from eachother. If you copy my code that is okay. Just try to understand it yourself. Try to figure out other solutions if you can. For example think about how a structure could of made my life easier or how to implement the bonuses which would mean redesigning some of the core functions and static helper functions here.

### Knowledge-Gained

I learnt so much during this project about so many new topics. It's hard to even know where to start. 

1.  The first new concept was that I could give a function the ... (From what I know it's called an Ellipsis?)
  1. Here is all I know about it. Firstly it is used to denote ranges, an unspecified number of arguments.
  2. It is part of the syntax for creating functions with a variable number of parameters. Uncertain if there is a way to use it without the va functions provided by the library stdarg.h.
  3. We can see a similarity with the argc and argv parameters when using a main function. Where they represent the amount of command-line arguments passed to the program.

4.
